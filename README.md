# Weekly Nerd @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019

For the weekly nerd we had to write three articles based on topics that where discussed during the minor webdevelopment.

The three articles that i wrote where:

- [Think Draw Code repeat](./Think_draw_code.md): This article is about planning your code to get more structured code.
- [Names in your code](./names_in_your_code.md): Is about using a naming convention for classes vs not using classes.
-  [Webdevelopment in year X](./Webdevelopment_in_year_X.md) is about the focus op webdevelopment and what is prioritised in online guides
