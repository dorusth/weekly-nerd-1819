# Webdevelopment in year X
Back when i first started writing code(2012) HTML, CSS and especially JS where in different stages and something I kept hearing was to “just use Jquery” when wanting to use interactions on a website. at the time it was the best/fasted option to write interaction without diving deep into the workings of javascript.

Over time  Jquery as become mostly obsolete, but other frameworks have come and taken its place for different features and reasons

## Just use [framework X]
If you look online for guides to learn web-development in 201X you you can see a trend in what most articles say:

#### General info
In most articles this is about  what the web is and the different languages, some articles go in a bit deeper and explain the connection between client and server and how files are served and some already give info on things like Git.

#### The basics
This part is very similar for most articles and mostly says “just learn HTML and CSS” most of  the times followed by a link to a tutorial or course.
One thing that always happens is a large focus on the importance on Javascript and how crucial it has become, followed by courses for learning Javascript.

#### Choose a framework
After noting the importance of Javascript in the current webbev climate a large portion of the articles a re focussed on what framework is bets to learn and why you should use said framework. Frameworks are often paired with package managers and build tools.
Sometimes you also get a design framework recommended like bootstrap or materialise which supply you with pre made elements styled in css.


The focus of current day web-development is heavily focussed on the new shiny things that come by and how you can make your flow more efficient and with the complexity of the [Developer roadmap](https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*YTP0ii6kEqZtxUN0bOKADA.png) you can see how much has been added to the skill-list of a developer.

## Mastering the basics
What i’ve learned in the minor Web-development is that the basics are underrated and core features bring you so much:

#### HTML
- Semantics& structure: Semantics are a really powerful tool to structure your code by giving elements the name that belongs to it’s function or hierarchic position.
- Accessibility: The web should be for everyone, and making your sites/apps accessible makes it that more people can use it, by paying attention tot structure, semantics and where necessary Aria tags you can make it that for example bind people can use your site/app with ease

#### CSS
- Naming: Giving an element the right name is more important than you might think, it makes it easier to find the element it belongs to for you and also for others that might work on your project later. find a way of consistently naming your elements like BEM or make one your self that works for you to structure your workflow.
- Support: CSS is constantly changing in regards of features and support is always changing, so if you keep up to dat with what features are added and with features are widely supported on platforms like [caniuse](https://www.caniuse.com) you can make your sites better and more efficient
- Structure: Just like naming structuring is important to easily make changes in your projects for you and others. there are many different ways to structure styling like SMACCS to keep a project structured as it grows.

#### JS
- The DOM: one of the tings that keeps coming back in every project you’ll do and every framework you’ll use is the DOM(Document Object Model) in some way shape or form, the DOM Represents all the elements on your site and you’ll be modifying it a lot with javascript.
- The call stack: The call stack is what keeps track of what your browser is doing and needs to do, by having a good grasp of how this works abstract concepts like asynchronous functionalities and promises are more easily understood
- Native API’s: By learning vanilla Javascript well you get a good idea of what the browser can do so you know what efficient ways are to write code, this makes it that you are less dependent on packages and have more control over your code.

## Conclusion
There are pro’s and cons to the vast amount of frameworks, library’s ad packages that are available for web-development, but it is always a good idea to  know your basics to be a better developer in the long run.
Frameworks come and go, but the core of a language will always come back in every framework
